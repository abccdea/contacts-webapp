## Backend Server

This is a backend server for the Contacts webapp.

You'll build the front end of the Contacts webapp. Because the course is on React and doesn't cover Node or servers, we've built this server and an API to interact with it so can focus on building the front end portion of the project in React.

### Setup

Getting the server running on your local machine takes only a few steps:

- `cd server`
- Install its dependencies - `npm install`
- Start the server - `node server.js`
- Visit URL: http://localhost:5001
